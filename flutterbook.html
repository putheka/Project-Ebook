                            Firstly, with reference to mobile application development, there has not been a great change.
                            Structurally what we have been doing, will continue to do.
                            Certainly a change in here and there had taken place. In the next section we'll discuss that and will take a deep dive.
                            Secondly, flutter web sections have got the makeover. Certainly it has become better.
                            Finally, a lot of changes have taken place in the desktop part.
                            Three months ago Google Flutter and Dart team announced Flutter support for Windows.</p>

                        <p class="tm-margin-b-p"><b>About the Book </b> <br>
                            Start as a Beginner and learn how to build Advanced Flutter 3.0 Apps in a few months.
                            What is the main advantage of this Book? It will always upgrade with Flutter.
                            It is at an advantage because I regularly write Flutter blog at my website , and besides, I keep updating this book.
                            As a result you can update your knowledge from lesser known facts to unknown facts about Flutter.
                            Consequently the pages and words have been increasing since I have first published this book. If you get the book, it will always give you the most recent development that takes place in Flutter widget and user interface world.
                            
                            In addition, as you progress, you'll find that more concise and succinct detail about the Flutter widgets, and besides that, inherent concepts regarding widgets are getting added in a regular basis. I hope, that'll help you to understand firstly, and secondly, build more robust Flutter applications.
                            
                            For example, although in the first part we used old Provider package, we've updated that to the new version in the later section.
                            
                            As you know, Flutter is a free and open-source mobile User Interface framework created by Google. Therefore, it doesn't cost you any money to build and test applications.
                            
                            There are other tools for the mobile application developers. But Flutter has distinguished itself for its simplicity.
                            
                            Moreover, Flutter has one single codebase that runs everywhere.
                            
                            By the way, Flutter uses on programming language in the background – Dart.
                            
                            Therefore, if you’re a beginner and want to learn Flutter from scratch, you must have a knowledge of Dart, as well. And, this book will help you to achieve this.
                            
                            Now, if you learn Flutter, with the help of one programming language Dart, you will be able to create two mobile applications at the same time.
                            
                            One for Android and the other for iOS.
                            
                            However, to start with you need to install Flutter that consists of SDK or Software Development Kit.
                            
                            In addition, the Flutter framework that consists of User Interface library based Widget will help you to build any design you want to do.
                            
                            This book will teach you from the very beginning. How to install Flutter, what IDE you need. Above all, how to build your first mobile application.
                            
                            Because Flutter uses Dart programming language, we will start with Flutter. But side by side we will also learn Dart and its implementation on Flutter.
                            
                            As time passes by, we’ll keep updating this book as Flutter gets upgraded, adding new features. Moreover, you’ll learn them also in this book</p>
