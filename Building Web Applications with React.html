                        <p class="tm-margin-b-p">I have a long history with web development. In 1999, when I was in high school, my parents gave me my first computer. I started tinkering with Microsoft FrontPage and built my early websites: fan websites for my favorite soccer players. <br>To this day, I still think FrontPage was a powerful tool that made many amateurs like me get into Web 1.0. What fascinated me about web development was how a few lines of HTML code in a plain text editor could turn into a web page. In 2006, I landed my first job as a web developer in New York City. At that time, jQuery was the prevalent utility in the industry. <br>Despite the co-existence of many fragmented browsers, jQuery unified the DOM standards and brought backward compatibility. In 2008, while working at a startup, I co-wrote a JavaScript Framework from scratch with a group of hardcore front-end engineers. <br>It was pretty cool! Even though some people disliked JavaScript for its lack of types and believed it would be short-lived, I loved how flexible and ubiquitous this language was. <br>To this day, JavaScript is still not dead yet, but even more popular. When I was running my business Roxy in 2016, React and Bootstrap were my primary go-to for building websites. React finally united HTML and JavaScript, and Bootstrap standardized the styles of UI components on both web and mobile. <br>Fast forward to 2023, React, Next.js, and Tailwind are now the go-to frameworks for building web applications. Almost every day, new applications pop up around the world using this trio. <br>These frameworks have become stepping stones for engineers and entrepreneurs to launch their products at a speed that I could never have imagined 20 years ago. <br>This is why I wrote this book: to demonstrate how you can effectively utilize these three tools to build web applications, regardless of whether you are a software engineer helping adopt new web stacks or an entrepreneur starting a software business <br>Dynamic Trio is a practical guide for web developers and entrepreneurs who want to learn how to use React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS to create modern web applications <br>The author, Grace Huang, with years of experience in web development, provides step-by-step tutorials on how to use these three powerful tools to build dynamic user interfaces, and server-side rendered applications with appealing styles. <br>Whether you're a seasoned developer or a business owner starting a software venture, this book will help you master the art of building web applications with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS in a practical way.</p>
